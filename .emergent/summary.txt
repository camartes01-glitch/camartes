**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build a mobile application that is an exact, fully functional replica of an existing web application called Camartes - Photography Ecosystem Platform. The source code for the web app was provided in a ZIP file.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Authentication**: Emergent Google Social Login.
- **AI Features**: Enable the chatbot using the Emergent LLM Key.
- **Scope**: Full feature set, matching the original web application. This includes user profiles, service browsing, provider profiles, a complete booking system, equipment rental management, user messaging, a blog, an analytics dashboard, and more.
- **Design**: Replicate the color and design of the original application (Amber/Orange primary, Purple/Pink secondary).
- **Payments**: Booking confirmation is sufficient for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP); full payment integration is not immediately required.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has set up a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and an Expo (React Native) frontend.
- **Backend**: A single, large  file has been created containing over 50 API endpoints and Pydantic models for all major features (users, services, bookings, equipment, portfolios, etc.). The database is MongoDB.
- **Frontend**: A comprehensive file structure has been created using Expo Router, including a tab-based navigation layout ( folder) and numerous screens for almost every feature mentioned in the original application. An  is set up for handling user sessions via Google Login. A  file defines the color scheme.

However, while the file structure and API endpoints are largely in place, the user's feedback indicates that the functionality within these components is incomplete and does not yet match the complexity of the original application.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was working on the user's request to make the inventory management, profile building (in the portfolio tab), and camera rental business features fully functional. It started by creating  and planned to link it from the Account screen.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: both. The backend has many new models and endpoints, which should be tested with . The frontend has new complex screens that need testing with the  to verify the UI and logic.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: P0 - App is not fully functional as per the original code.
-   **Issue 2**: P1 - Potential for recurring Metro bundler caching issues.
-   **Issue 3**: P2 -  component caused a crash, indicating potential for similar import issues in the many newly created files.

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1: App is not fully functional as per the original code.**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent has been adding screens and components in response to user requests. Most recently, it created . This approach is incremental but has not yet achieved the fully functional state the user wants.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Implement the full logic for inventory management in , including adding, viewing, and editing items.
        2.  Connect the  screen to the backend  endpoints.
        3.  Implement profile building features within the  and  screens.
        4.  Flesh out the camera rental business workflow, which likely involves the booking flow (), equipment management, and user profiles.
        5.  Review the original code's , , and  to understand the required complexity and implement these features.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the user's primary goal. Fixing this will move the project closer to the user's definition of complete.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

-   **Issue 2: Potential for recurring Metro bundler caching issues.**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent previously faced syntax errors that persisted due to caching. The fixes involved clearing the cache using [11:05:14] Starting project at /app/frontend and .
    -   **Next debug checklist**: If the frontend doesn't reflect changes after a restart (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started):
        1.  Run [11:05:16] Starting project at /app/frontend to clear the cache.
        2.  As a last resort, use  and  followed by a restart.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a development workflow impediment that wastes time and can lead to confusion about whether code changes have been applied.
    -   **Status**: RESOLVED (but with potential to recur)
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Core App Functionality (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent just created . The next step is to add the logic to this file, connect it to the backend, and then implement the other features requested by the user (profile building in portfolio, camera rental flow).
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: Fulfill the user's latest request and make the app's core features (Inventory, Portfolio, Rentals) fully operational.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    -   **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks (P1): Implement Missing Advanced Features from Original Code**

    - Implemented a theme with the user's specified colors in .
    - Enhanced the UI/UX of the  and  tabs.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
There are no major issues that were mentioned and completely ignored. The primary issue is the ongoing user request for more complete functionality, which the agent is actively working on.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None. This is the first summary.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, Expo Router (file-based routing), Zustand (state management), Axios (HTTP requests).
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, MongoDB (via  async driver).
- **Authentication**: Emergent Google Social Login.
- **AI**: Emergent LLM Key for a chatbot feature.
- **Architecture**: Monorepo-like structure with separate  and  directories.

**key DB schema**
Defined as Pydantic models within :
- : {user_id, full_name, email, role, bio, location, etc.}
- : {provider_id, title, description, category, pricing, etc.}
- : {user_profile_id, business_name, address, etc.}
- : {user_id, provider_id, service_id, booking_date, status, etc.}
- : {user_id, provider_id, rating, comment, etc.}
- : {sender_id, receiver_id, content, timestamp, etc.}
- : {user_profile_id, title, description, image_url_or_base64, etc.}
- : {owner_id, name, description, rental_price, availability, etc.}
- : {owner_id, name, description, price, services_included, etc.}
- ...and many more related to notifications, analytics, etc.

**changes in tech stack**
- None. The project adheres to the initial Expo/FastAPI/MongoDB template.

**All files of reference**
- **Backend**:  (created and overwritten multiple times to add all API endpoints).
- **Frontend Core**:
  - : Manages authentication state.
  - : Defines the application's color palette.
  - : Root layout, wraps the app in .
  - : Defines the main tab navigation structure.
- **Frontend Screens (Created)**:
  - All files inside .
  - , , , , , , , , , , , and many more.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- ****: This is a very large monolithic file containing all models, routes, and logic. It should be broken down into a more maintainable structure (e.g., separate files for routes, models, and services/business logic).
- **Frontend Components**: Many screens were created in bulk. They likely contain placeholder or incomplete logic. A thorough review is needed to ensure data is fetched correctly, state is managed properly, and all UI elements are fully interactive and connected to the backend.

**key api endpoints**
All prefixed with .
-  (for authentication)
- , 
- , 
- , 
- 
- , 
- 
- 
- 
- ...and many more CRUD endpoints for all defined models.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user's primary goal is to achieve full functional parity with the original web application code they provided. Simply creating files for screens is not enough; the logic within them must be implemented.
- The next agent should focus on implementing the detailed logic for the features the user most recently requested: **inventory management, profile building in the portfolio, and the camera rental business workflow**.
- Be prepared to deal with potential Metro bundler caching issues. If the frontend preview doesn't update, use [11:05:17] Starting project at /app/frontend.
- The backend  is a single large file. While functional, it's hard to navigate. Be methodical when adding or modifying backend logic.
- The user is acting as the primary tester. Pay close attention to their feedback as it directly points to the next set of required implementations.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User**:  - **Status**: Completed. Agent updated UI for these tabs.
2.  **User**:  - **Status**: In Progress. Agent started creating dashboard and inventory components.
3.  **User**:  - **Status**: In Progress. Agent analyzed original code and created an enhanced booking flow screen.
4.  **User**:  - **Status**: **PENDING**. This is the current highest-priority task. The agent has just started on it by creating an  file.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The application is not fully functional according to the user. Many created screens have placeholder logic. An error in  ( import) recently crashed the app, indicating other similar issues might exist in the newly created files.
- **Mocked**: Many of the UI screens exist as files, but the intricate logic, state management, and API integrations required to make them fully functional are still in progress or missing.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Emergent Google Social Login**: Used for user authentication. Requires Emergent LLM Key implicitly for token exchange.
- **OpenAI (via Emergent LLM Key)**: For the AI ChatBot feature. The key  has been retrieved.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
- **Test files created**: None.
- **Known regressions**: None identified, as the app is still in the initial build phase.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- N/A. The application uses Google Social Login.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has focused on scaffolding the entire application by creating a vast number of files. However, it has consistently underestimated the user's request for full functionality, which requires implementing the detailed business logic *inside* those files.
- Several advanced features identified by the agent from the original code have not been started yet (e.g., QC Photo Manager, Provider Comparison tool, advanced analytics). The agent planned to implement them but got redirected by the user's more immediate requests.
